# Face Detection with OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using **OpenCV** and the **Haar Cascade Classifier**.  
It uses your device's camera to detect faces and highlight them with bounding boxes in a live video feed.

## Features
- Real-time face detection via webcam.
- Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade model.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces.
- Lightweight and easy to set up.

## How It Works
1. OpenCV captures frames from your webcam.
2. The Haar Cascade Classifier scans each frame to detect faces.
3. Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes.

## Requirements
- Python   
- opencv-python  
- numpy
